        While I initially set out to complete 10 projects as part of my Buildspace S5 journey, unforeseen circumstances prevented me from achieving this goal in its entirety. 
        <br /><br />Despite falling short of my target, I successfully built 4 projects that significantly helped me develop a better understanding of the MERN stack. 
        <br /><br /> <b>This experience taught me that progress, no matter how incremental, 
        is valuable and that persistence in the face of challenges is crucial. </b>
        <br /><br />Moving forward, I am more committed to continue my learning journey and complete the remaining projects.
